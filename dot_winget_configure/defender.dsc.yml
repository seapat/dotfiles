Windows Defender does not exceed the percentage of CPU usage that you specify. The default value is 50.
      CheckForSignaturesBeforeRunningScan: true # Indicates whether to check for new virus and spyware definitions before Windows Defender runs a scan. If you specify a value of $True, Windows Defender checks for new definitions. If you specify $False or do not specify a value, the scan begins with existing definitions. This value applies to scheduled scans and to scans that you start from the command line, but it does not affect scans that you start from the user interface.
